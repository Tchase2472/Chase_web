       <p>.....And so it begins.</p>
       
    </div>
    <div class="main-content">
        <br>
        <p>The job search has entered its' first month. There have been no offers. There <em>has</em> been a lot of support though.
            <p>Its more impotant than anyone thinks, actually. </p>
        <p>I don't think I would be able to continue without it. <p>Ok, ok, I get it, it's only been a month.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Well,.........not quite. The journey to the holy coding space has actually been going on now for not quite 4 years.</p>
        <p>It has been a much longer road than I would have ever suspected. And it has been fraught with troubles.</p>
        <p>I'd like to look a bit deeper at the road I have taken to get here.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I started learning web development I had absolutely no previous knowledge of programming.</p>
        <p>I worked in an office. I could create a Word document and maybe a nice spreadsheet. That's about it.</p>
        <p>I was thought of as a "computer guy" because I could make the printer work sometimes.</p>
        <p>It's laughable to think I was ever considered anything like a "computer guy" knowing what I know now.</p>
        <p>Anyway, "things" happened and I found myself looking for a new career. My wife suggested web development.</p>
        <p>This was interesting. I thought, "Yeah, I can do that. Easy." Yeah, OK, when you've stopped laughing I will continue.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And so it began. I had no idea where to even start. I hopped on the computer and did some research. It seems that the place to start</p>
        <p>was to learn something called "javascript". Ok, I can do that. Won't take a minute...... </p>
        <p>This was the first stop on the road to the holy coding space. And it was my first error. Now, don't get me wrong,</p>
        <p>you do need to know javascript. You need HTML and CSS as well, of course. </p>
        <p>No, the error was diving head first into the language without bothering to learn all the things that go in, on, over, and around the language.</p>
        <p>There is a lot of stuff that is not, strictly speaking, javascript, but is vital to know about javascript. </p>
        <br>
        <p>A lot of people are going to disagree with me here. I do understand, and I agree, you have to start <em>somewhere</em>, don't you? Yes, you do.</p>
        <p>My point here is that there is a Level 0 before there is a Level 1. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Level 0, you say? What the hell is Level 0? Level 0 is orientation. We often think of our computers to consist of "environments" or "spaces".</p>
        <p>It is vital that a new student be introduced the what a thing is and where the thing is in a certain space and what is the relationship between these different spaces and the objects that inhabit them.</p>
        <p>This is what I mean by the things in, on, over, and around the language. </p>
        <p>You may take this to mean teaching the newbie about code editors and other such peripheral tools. No, I mean introducing the new guy to the simple basics.</p>
        <p>Things like what a computer is. But not just in terms of the machine itself, but rather how the language interacts with that machine, and why.</p>
        <p>There is no substitute for actual <em>understanding</em> as opposed to learning "just enough to get a job". It all starts with Level 0.</p>
        <p>Now, I understand, there is A LOT to know at this level. But I believe it is time well spent. Once you get past that hurdle, the rest will still be tough, but not impossible.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is important to remember that this is NOT the way I did it. I jumped in head first into the shallow end of the pool. I spent <em>years</em></p>
        <p>trying to figure all this stuff out. I am 100% not an expert at all. </p>
        <p>But I have learned one painful lesson, there are no shorcuts. </p>
        <p>There is, however, a better way than jumping around from one thing to another in a desparate frenzy trying to understand something.</p>
        <p>It's learning the bare bone basics. </p> 
        <br>
        <p>I think it is fair to take everything I have said with some grains of salt. After all, I haven't found my next job yet either. </p>
        <p>But I have been walking this road for some time now.</p>
        <p>And I have walked up many blind alleys. And I have fallen for many "fads". In fact, I think I have made every mistake you can make.</p>
        <p>All I ask is that, if you're having trouble or feel like you should give up, don't. </p>
        <p>Look for one thing you really understand, then do that thing. Then take the next thing you really understand, and so on.</p>
        <p>If you get stuck, settle in and learn the basics of the thing. Time is a secondary concern to understanding. </p>
        <p>Anyway, that's the story up to now. I'll check in later. I wish you the best of luck, and maybe someday we will meet at the holy coding space at last.</p>
